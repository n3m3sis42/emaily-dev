Emaily allows users to create simple email surveys with clickable feedback links, and tracks the link each recipient clicked. 

Users sign in using Google authentication and may purchase site credits through the Stripe payment API. The app will charge the user one credit for each survey created, and will list the user's surveys along with a tally of recipients' responses.
